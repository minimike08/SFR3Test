#  SFR3 Coding Challenge

## This app will load data from Spoonacular's api and dispaly it in a grid view

## Setup
### The external dependencies are managed by SPM and should be loaded once the project is opened.
### Build and run the project.

## Use
### There are two tabs a Search tab and a Favorites tab. The search tab allows the user to type something in the search bar and hit "Search", after which a grid of results will be displayed. Tapping a result will take the user to a detail page where they can see more about the recipe and mark it as a favorite. The favorites tab allows the user to view the recipes they've already marked as a favorite and see their details, as well. 

## Architecture
### The app follows an MVVM style architecture. It is currently a monolith, but everything is separated and could be broken up into modules at a later date (if this was a something that would ever be used again, for instance). 

## Demo
### There is a sample of this app functionality in the root of the repo: [Video](./AppDemo.mp4)
